# Snake - Tetris game (Python 3-OOP-Turtle)
Snake - Tetris game (built in Python 3 using OOP concept and Turtle library)

Feeling nostalgic for the "eternal game" of Tetris? This is my first game made in Python 3 using OOP concept and Turtle library. Play and collect points. The player's highest score is recorded in a separate file.

I wish you a pleasant game)
